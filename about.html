                        <h2>About This Disease </h2>
                        <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered
                            coronavirus. Since the covid-19 outbreak,
                            â€œthe instability and fear that the pandemic
                            engenders is exacerbating existing human rights concerns, such as discrimination
                            against common people. A common pattern in discriminatory acts occurring during the
                            pandemic stating that the outbreak of communicable diseases might cause fear anxiety.
                            It is a disease that's new and for which there are still many unknowns. We are often afraid
                            of the unknown and it is easy to associate that fear with 'others'. To measure incidents
                            of discrimination, respondents were asked if "people thinking they might have the
                            coronavirus" acted as if they were afraid of them, threatened or harassed them, treated
                            them with less courtesy and respect, or gave them poorer service at every place.</p>

                    <h2>History Of Disease</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first case was identified in wuhan, china in december 2019. Since its a communicable
                        desease it
                        started spreading all over the world. The covid -19 pendamic in India is part of the
                        worldwide pendamic
                        of coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19). The first case of COVID-19 in india , which
                        originated from china,
                        was reported on 30 january 2020. India currently has the largest number of confirmed cases
                        in asia,[7]
                        and has the second-highest number of confirmed cases in the world. The online study
                        investigated
                        predictors of fear of corona virus. When there is insufficient fear, this may also result in
                        harm for
                        individuals and society. Mostly uneducated people does this kind of discrimination with
                        others, whose
                        who don't have much information about this covid disease. The research team found that in
                        some earlier
                        weeks of the pandemic, people who were heavy users of social media were more likely to
                        report an
                        experience of discrimination. They also found that experiences of discrimination were
                        associated with
                        increased anxiety and depression, consistent with literature associating general
                        discrimination with
                        poorer mental health especially among racial/ethnic minorities."The early spike in the
                        percentage of
                        people who experienced COVID-related discrimination was attributable -- in part -- to
                        discriminatory
                        reactions to the growing number of people wearing masks or face coverings at the early stage
                        of the pandemic.
